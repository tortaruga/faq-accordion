### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I know I said jumping from html to css to js is a recipe for disaster but I think I work better like this. I started with the html and part of the css (mainly the layout), but then left the details, colors, fonts, and so on to focus on the JS part. I think it helped because instead of getting lost into trying to replicate the design (knowing I still had the js to do!) I focused on the functional part first, and only "wasted" time on the design when I knew that the heaviest part was already taken care of and working. So psychologically I felt calmer even though I wasn't necessarily faster in completing the challenge, although I still think I should organize the work ahead a bit and not just jump into the unknown.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

I learned that when you click on a label for a button you trigger the button's action... I thought the label was purely descriptive.

Also, for the function to be triggered on keypress I have to prevent the default behavior first. I tried 15 different approaches thinking the problem was the function when just one line got the thing working!

### Continued development

I'm not the best at accessibility, and I'm still rubbish at writing DRY code, also I think mainly my js is one big headache to read
